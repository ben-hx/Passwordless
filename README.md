Passwordless authentication for the PHP Slim microframework
===========================================================

This passwordless token-based email authentication is inspired by [Ben
Brown](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login) and [Justin Balthorp](https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb).

It's modeled after the [Passwordless](https://passwordless.net/) Node js
package and provides middleware for the [Slim microframework](http://slimframework.com).

Right now it's in it's early stages and not ready even for alpha use.
